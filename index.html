<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>Horror</h2>
<h3>Exorcist</h3>
<p>This movie recounts what happened after the demon was exorcised from Linda Blair.  How it tradgically finds and possesses the body of the excising preist Fr. Karras, requiring another exorcism.</p>
<h3>Lost Boys</h3>
<p>Just a group of undead teenage boys having fun and enjoing the Califoria coast.  Keifer Sutherland stars as David, the leader of the Vampire pack, and Jason Patrick as the big brother being lead down a dark path.  It is up to Cory Haime, and the aptly named Frog Brothers, one of which is Cory Feldman, to save the day.</p>
<h3>Desk to Dawn</h3>
<p>How can you go wrong with a movie that includes Selma Hyack, Cheech Marin playing 3 characters and Quintin Tarentino?  Another Vampire movie, this movie is extremely graphic, not appropiate for kids under 13 or 14.</p>
